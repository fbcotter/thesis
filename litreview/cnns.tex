\subsection{The Neuron and Single Layer Neural Networks}

\begin{figure}

  \input{\imgpath/singlelayer}
  \mycaption{A single neuron}{The neuron is composed of inputs $x_i$, weights
    $w_i$ (and a bias term), as well as an activation function. Typical activation
    functions include the sigmoid function, tanh function and the ReLU}
  \label{fig:ch2:singlelayer}
\end{figure}

The neuron, shown in \autoref{fig:ch2:singlelayer} is the core building block of
Neural Networks. It takes the dot product between an input vector $\vec{x} \in
\reals[D]$ and a weight vector $\vec{w}$, before applying a chosen nonlinearity,
$g$. I.e.
%
\begin{equation}
  y = g(\langle\vec{x}, \vec{w}\rangle) = g\left(\sum_{i=0}^{D} x_i w_i \right) 
\end{equation}
%
where we have used the shorthand $b=w_0$ and $x_0 = 1$. Also note that we will
use the neural network common practice of calling the \emph{weights} $w$,
compared to the parameters $\theta$ we have been discussing thus far.

Typical nonlinear functions $g$ are the sigmoid function (already presented in 
\eqref{eq:ch2:sigmoid}), but also common are the tanh and ReLU functions:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \F{tanh}(x) &=& \frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}} \label{eq:ch2:tanh}\\
  \F{ReLU}(x) &=& \max (x, 0) \label{eq:ch2:relu}
\end{eqnarray}

See \autoref{fig:ch2:nonlinearities} for plots of these. The original Rosenblatt
perceptron \cite{rosenblatt_perceptron:_1958} used the Heaviside function
$\F{H}(x) = \mathbb{I}(x > 0)$. % The sigmoid nonlinearity
% naturally arises when we want to do classification with class labels $\{0,1\}$,
% as does the tanh function for classification with class labels $\{-1, 1\}$. The
% ReLU however is used more often in deeper architectures
% \cite{nair_rectified_2010}.

Note that if $\langle\vec{w}, \vec{w}\rangle = 1$ then $\langle\vec{x},
\vec{w}\rangle$ is the distance from the point $\vec{x}$ to the hyperplane with
normal $\vec{w}$. With general $\vec{w}$ this can be thought of as a scaled
distance. Thus, the weight vector $\vec{w}$ defines a hyperplane in $\reals[D]$
which splits the space into two. The choice of nonlinearity then affects how
points on each side of the plane are treated. For a sigmoid, points far below
the plane get mapped to 0 and points far above the plane get mapped to 1 (with
points near the plane having a value of 0.5). For tanh nonlinearities, these
points get mapped to -1 and 1. For ReLU nonlinearities, every point below the
plane ($\langle\vec{x}, \vec{w}\rangle < 0$) gets mapped to zero and every point
above the plane keeps its inner product value. 

Nearly all modern neural networks use the ReLU nonlinearity and it has
been credited with being a key reason for the recent surge in deep learning
success \cite{glorot_deep_2011, nair_rectified_2010}. In particular:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is less sensitive to initial conditions as the gradients that
  backpropagate through it will be large even if $x$ is large. A common
  observation of sigmoid and tanh non-linearities was that their learning would
  be slow for quite some time until the neurons came out of saturation, and then
  their accuracy would increase rapidly before levelling out again at
  a minimum~\citep{glorot_understanding_2010}. The ReLU, on the other hand, has
  constant gradient.
\item It promotes sparsity in outputs, by setting them to a hard 0. Studies
  on brain energy expenditure suggest that neurons encode information in
  a sparse manner. \citet{lennie_cost_2003} estimates the percentage of
  neurons active at the same time to be between 1 and 4\%. Sigmoid and tanh
  functions will typically have \emph{all} neurons firing, while 
  the ReLU can allow neurons to fully turn off.
\end{enumerate}

  \mycaption{Common Neural Network nonlinearities and their gradients}{The sigmoid, tanh and ReLU
  nonlinearities are commonly used activation functions for neurons. Note the
  different properties. In particular, the tanh and sigmoid have the nice
  property of being smooth but can have saturation when the input is either
  largely positive or largely negative, causing little gradient to flow back
  through it. The ReLU does not suffer from this problem, and has the additional
  nice property of setting values to exactly 0, making a sparser output
  activation.}
  \label{fig:ch2:nonlinearities}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Multilayer Perceptrons}
As mentioned in the previous section, a single neuron can be thought of as a
separating hyperplane with an activation that maps the two halves of the space
to different values. Such a linear separator is limited, and famously cannot
solve the XOR problem \cite{minsky_perceptrons:_1988}. Fortunately, adding a
single hidden layer like the one shown in \autoref{fig:ch2:hidden} can change
this, and it is provable that with an infinitely wide hidden layer, a neural
network can approximate any function \cite{hornik_multilayer_1989,
cybenko_approximation_1989}. 

The forward pass of such a network with one hidden layer of $H$ units is:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  h_i & = & g\left(\sum_{j=0}^{D} x_j w_{ij}^{(1)}\right) \\
  y & = & \sum_{k=0}^{H} h_k w^{(2)}_{k}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $w^{(l)}$ denotes the weights for the $l$-th layer, of which
\autoref{fig:ch2:hidden} has 2. Note that these individual layers are often
called \emph{fully connected} as each node in the previous layer affects every
node in the next.

If we were to expand this network to have $L$ such fully connected layers, we
could rewrite the action of each layer in a recursive fashion:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  Y^{(l+1)} &=& W^{(l+1)}X^{(l)}  \label{eq:ch2:fc1}\\
  X^{(l+1)} &=& g\left(Y^{(l+1)}\right) \label{eq:ch2:fc2} 
\end{eqnarray}
where $W$ is now a weight matrix, acting on the vector of previous layer's
outputs $X^{(l)}$. As we are now considering every layer an input to the next
stage, we have removed the $h$ notation, and added the superscript $(l)$ to
define the depth. $X^{(0)}$ is the network input and $Y^{(L)}$ is the network
output. Let us say that the output has $C$ nodes, and a hidden layer $X^{(l)}$
has $C_l$ nodes.

  \mycaption{Multi-layer perceptron}{Expanding the single neuron from 
  \autoref{fig:ch2:singlelayer} to a network of neurons. The internal
  representation units are often referred to as the \emph{hidden layer} as they
  are an intermediary between the input and output.}
  \label{fig:ch2:hidden}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Backpropagation}
It is important to truly understand backpropagation when designing neural
networks, so we describe the core concepts now for a neural network with
$L$ layers.

The delta rule, initially designed for networks with no hidden layers 
\cite{widrow_neurocomputing:_1988}, was expanded to what we now consider
\emph{backpropagation} in \cite{rumelhart_parallel_1986}. While backpropagation
is conceptually just the application of the chain rule, Rumelhart, Hinton, and
Williams successfully updated the delta rule to networks with hidden layers,
laying a key foundational step for deeper networks. 

With a deep network, calculating $\dydx{J}{w}$ may not seem
particularly obvious if $w$ is a weight in one of the earlier layers. We need
to define a rule for updating the weights in all $L$ layers of the network,
$W^{(1)}, W^{(2)}, \ldots W^{(L)}$ however, only the final set $W^{(L)}$ are
connected to the objective function $J$. 

\subsubsection{Regression Loss}
Let us start with writing down the derivative of $J$ with respect to the network
output $Y^{(L)}$ using the regression objective function \eqref{eq:ch2:mle_reg}. 
As we now have two superscripts,
one for the sample number and one for the layer number, we combine them into a
tuple of superscripts. 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \dydx{J}{Y^{(L)}} &= & \dydx{}{Y^{(L)}} \left( \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N_b}\frac{1}{2} \left(y^{(n)} - Y^{(L, n)}\right)^2\right) \\
                    &=& \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N_b} \left(Y^{(L, n)} - y^{(n)} \right) \\
                    &=& e \in \reals \label{eq:ch2:reg_b1}
\end{eqnarray}
where we have used the fact that for the regression case, $y^{(n)}, Y^{(L,n)}
\in \reals$. 

\subsubsection{Classification Loss}
For the classification case \eqref{eq:ch2:mle_class}, let us keep the output of
the network $Y^{(L,n)} \in \reals[C]$ and define an intermediate value $\hat{y}$ the
softmax applied to this vector $\hat{y}^{(n)}_c = \sigma_c\left(Y^{(L, n)}\right)$.
Note that this is a vector valued function going from $\reals[C] \rightarrow
\reals[C]$ so has a jacobian matrix $S_{ij} = \dydx{\hat{y}_i}{Y^{(L)}_j}$ with
values:
\begin{equation}
  S_{ij} = \begin{cases}
    \sigma_i (1-\sigma_j) & \text{if $i=j$}\\
    -\sigma_i \sigma_j & \text{if $i\neq j$}\\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Now, let us return to \eqref{eq:ch2:mle_class} and find the derivative of the
objective function to this intermediate value $\hat{y}$:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \dydx{J}{\hat{y}} &= & \dydx{}{\hat{y}} \left( \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N_b} \sum_{c=1}^C 
  y^{(n)}_c \log \hat{y}^{(n)}_c \right) \\
  &=& \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N_b} \sum_{c=1}^C \frac{y^{(n)}_c}{\hat{y}^{(n)}_c} \\
  &=& d \in \reals[C] \label{eq:ch2:class_b1}
\end{eqnarray}
Note that unlike \eqref{eq:ch2:reg_b1}, this derivative is vector valued. To
find $\dydx{J}{Y^{(L)}}$ we use the chain rule. It is easier to find the
partial derivative with respect to one node in the output first, and then expand
from here. I.e.:

\begin{eqnarray}
  \dydx{J}{Y^{(L)}_j} &=& \sum_{i=1}^C \dydx{J}{\hat{y}_i}\dydx{\hat{y}_i}{Y^{(L)}_j} \\
                      &=& S_i^T d
\end{eqnarray}
where $S_i$ is the $i$th column of the jacobian matrix $S$. It becomes clear now
that to get the entire vector derivative for all nodes in $Y^{(L)}$, we must
multiply the transpose of the jacobian matrix with the error term from
\eqref{eq:ch2:class_b1}:
\begin{equation}
  \dydx{J}{Y^{(L)}} = S^T d
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Final Layer Weight Gradient} \label{sec:ch2:weight}
Let us continue by assuming $\dydx{J}{Y^{(L)}}$ is vector valued as was the case
with classification. For regression, it is easy to set $C=1$ in the following to
get the necessary results. Additionally for clarity, we will drop the layer
superscript in the intermediate calculations.

We call the gradient for the final layer weights the \emph{update} gradient. 
It can be computed by the chain rule again:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \dydx{J}{W_{ij}} &=& \dydx{J}{Y_i} \dydx{Y_i}{W_{ij}} + 2\lambda W_{ij} \\
  &=& \dydx{J}{Y_i} X_j + 2\lambda W_{ij}
\end{eqnarray}
where the second term in the above two equations comes from the regularization
loss that is added to the objective. The gradient of the entire weight matrix is 
then:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \dydx{J}{W^{(L)}} &=& \dydx{J}{\hat{y}} X^T +2\lambda W \\
   &=& S^T d \left(X^{(L-1)}\right)^T + 2\lambda W^{(L)} \in \reals[C \x C_{L-1}]
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Final Layer Passthrough Gradient} \label{sec:ch2:passthrough}
Additionally, we want to find the \emph{passthrough} gradients of the final
layer $\dydx{J}{X^{(L-1)}}$. In a similar fashion, we first find the gradient
with respect to individual elements in $X^{(L-1)}$ before generalizing to the
entire vector:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \dydx{J}{X_i} &=& \sum_{j=1}^{C} \dydx{J}{Y_j} \dydx{Y_j}{X_i} \\
                &=& \sum_{j=1}^{C} \dydx{J}{Y_j} W_{j,i} \\
                &=& W_{i}^T\dydx{J}{Y} \\
\end{eqnarray}
where $W_i$ is the $i$th column of $W$. Thus
\begin{eqnarray}
  \dydx{J}{X^{(L-1)}} &=& \left(W^{(L)}\right)^T \dydx{J}{Y^{(L)}} \\
                      &=& \left( W^{(L)} \right)^T S^T d
\end{eqnarray}
This passthrough gradient then can be used to update the next layer's weights by
repeating \autoref{sec:ch2:weight} and \autoref{sec:ch2:passthrough}.

\subsubsection{General Layer Update}
The easiest way to handle this flow of gradients, and the basis for most
automatic differentiation packages, is the block definition shown in
\autoref{fig:ch2:block_form}. For all neural network components (even if they do
not have weights), the operationg must not only be able to calculate the forward 
pass $y=f(x, w)$ given weights $w$ and inputs $x$, but also calculate the
\emph{update} and \emph{passthrough} gradients $\dydx{J}{w}, \dydx{J}{x}$ given
an input gradient $\dydx{J}{y}$. The input gradient will have the same shape as
$y$ as will the update and passthrough gradients match the shape of $w$ and $x$.
This way, gradients for the entire network cam be computed in an iterative
fashion starting at the loss function and moving backwards.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{\imgpath/deeplearn_block}
  \mycaption{General block form for autograd}{All neural network functions
  need to be able to calculate the forward pass $y=f(x,w)$ as well as the 
  update and passthrough gradients $\dydx{J}{w}, \dydx{J}{x}$. Backpropagation
  is then easily done by allowing data to flow backwards through these blocks
  from the loss.}
  \label{fig:ch2:block_form}
\end{figure}

\section{Convolutional Neural Networks}
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a special type of of Neural Network where the
weights of the fully connected layer are shared across the layer. 
In this way, a neuron at a given layer is only affected by
nodes from the previous layer in a given neighbourhood rather than every node.

First popularized in 1998 by LeCun et. al in \cite{lecun_gradient-based_1998},
the convolutional layer was introduced to build invariance with respect to
translations, as well as reduce the parameter size of early neural networks for
pattern recognition. The idea of having a locally receptive field had already
been shown to be a naturally occurring phenomen by Hubel and Wiesel
\cite{hubel_receptive_1962}. They did not become popular immediately, and
another spatially based keypoint extractor, SIFT \cite{lowe_distinctive_2004},
was the mainstay of detection systems until the AlexNet CNN
\cite{krizhevsky_imagenet_2012} won the 2012 ImageNet challenge
\cite{russakovsky_imagenet_2014} by a large margin over the next competitors who
used SIFT and Support Vector Machines \cite{cortes_support-vector_1995}. This
CNN had 5 convolutional layers followed by 3 fully connected layers.

We will briefly describe the convolutional layer, as well as many other layers
that have become popular in the past few years.

\subsection{Convolutional Layers}
In the presentation of neural networks so far, we have considered column vectors 
$X^{(l)},Y^{(l)} \in \reals[C_{l}]$. Convolutional layers for image analysis
have a different format. In particular, the spatial component of the input is
preserved. 

Let us first consider the definition of 2-D convolution for single channel
images:
\begin{eqnarray}
  y[\nn] = (x\conv h)[\nn] &=& \sum_{\mathbf{k}} x[\mathbf{k}]h[\nn-\mathbf{k}] \label{eq:ch2:conv1}\\
                      &=& \sum_{k_1, k_2} x[k_1,k_2]h[n_1-k_1, n_2-k_2]
\end{eqnarray}
where the sum is done over the support of $h$. For an input $x\in \reals[H\x W]$
and filter $h\in \reals[K_1\x K_2]$ the output has spatial support $y\in
\reals[H+K_1-1 \x W+K_2-1]$. 

In the context of convolutional layers, this filter $h$ is a \emph{matched filter} 
that gives its largest output when the input contains $h$. If the input has
shapes similar to $h$ in many locations, each of these locations in $y$ will
also have large outputs. 

It is not enough to only have a single matched filter, often we would like to
have a bank of them, each sensitive to different shapes. For example, if $h_1$
was sensitive to horizontal edges, we may also want to detect vertical and
diagonal edges. Without specifying what each of the filters do, we can however
specify that we would like to detect $C$ different shapes over the spatial
extent of an input.

This then means that we have $C$ output channels:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  y_1[\nn] &=& (x \conv h_1)[\nn] \\
  y_2[\nn] &=& (x \conv h_1)[\nn] \\
           &\vdots & \\
  y_C[\nn] &=& (x \conv h_1)[\nn] 
\end{eqnarray*}

If we stack red, green and blue input channels on top of each other, we have a 
3-dimensional array $x \in \reals[C\x H\x W]$ with $C=3$.\footnote{In deep 
learning literature, there is not consensus about whether to stack the outputs
with the channel first ($\reals[C\x H\x W]$) or last ($\reals[H\x W\x C]$). The
latter is more common in Image Processing for colour and spectral images,
however the former is the standard for the deep learning framework we use --
PyTorch \cite{paszke_automatic_2017}, so we use this in this thesis.} 
In a CNN layer, each filter $h$ is 3 dimensional with spatial extent exactly
equal to $C$. The \emph{convolution} is done over the remaining two dimensions
and the $C$ outputs are summed at each pixel location. This makes
\eqref{eq:ch2:conv1}:
\begin{eqnarray}
  y[\nn] &=& \sum_{c=1}^C \sum_{\mathbf{k}} x[\mathbf{k}]h[c, \nn-\mathbf{k}]
  \label{eq:ch2:conv2}
\end{eqnarray}

Again, we would like to have many matched filters to find different shapes in
the previous layer, so we repeat \autoref{eq:ch2:conv2} $F$ times and stack the
output to give $y \in \reals[F \x H\x W]$: 
%
\begin{equation}
  y[f, \nn] &=& \sum_{c=1}^C \sum_{\mathbf{k}} x[c, \mathbf{k}]h_f[c, \nn-\mathbf{k}]
  \label{eq:ch2:conv3}
\end{equation}

After a convolutional layer, we can then apply a pointwise nonlinearity $g$ to
each output location in $y$. Revisiting \eqref{eq:ch2:fc1} and \eqref{eq:ch2:fc2}, we can 
rewrite this for a convolutional layer at depth $l$ with $C_l$ input and
$C_{l+1}$ output channels:
\begin{eqnarray}
  Y^{(l+1)}[f, \nn] &=& \sum_{c=1}^{C_l} X^{(l)}[c, \nn] \conv h^{(l)}_f[c, \nn] \qquad 
    \text{for } 1 \leq f \leq C_{l+1} \label{eq:ch2:conv4}\\
  X^{(l+1)}[f, \nn] &=& g\left(Y^{(l)}[f, \nn]\right)
\end{eqnarray}
This is shown in \autoref{fig:ch2:conv_layer}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{\imgpath/conv}
  \mycaption{A convolutional layer}{A convolutional layer followed by a
  nonlinearity $g$. The previous layer's activations are convolved with a bank
  of $C_{l+1}$ filters, each of which has spatial size $k_h\x k_w$ and depth
  $C_l$. Note that there is no convolution across the channel dimension. Each
  filter produces one output channel in $y^{(l+1)}$.}
  \label{fig:ch2:conv_layer}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Padding and Stride}
Regular 2-D convolution expands the input from size $H\x W$ to $(H+K_H-1)\x
(W+K_W-1)$. In convolutional layers in neural networks, it is often desirable
and common to have the same output size as input size. This is achieved by
taking the central $H\x W$ outputs. We call this \emph{same-size convolution}.
Another option commonly used is to only evaluate the kernels where they fully
overlap the input signal, causing a reduction in the output size to $(H-K_H+1)
\x (W-K_W+1)$. This is called \emph{valid convolution} and was used in the
original LeNet-5 \cite{lecun_gradient-based_1998}.

Signal extension is by default \emph{zero padding}, and most deep learning
frameworks have no ability to choose other padding schemes as part of their
convolution functions. Other padding such as \emph{symmetric padding} can be
achieved by expanding the input signal before doing a valid convolution.

Stride is a commonly used term in deep learning literature. A stride of 2 means
that we evaluate the filter kernel at every other sample point. In signal
processing, this is simply called decimation.

\subsubsection{Gradients}
To get the update and passthrough gradients for the convolutional layer we will need to expand
\eqref{eq:ch2:conv4}. Again we will drop the layer superscripts for clarity. For
simplicity, let us assume that the convolutional filters are square and only have
support in the region $a \leq n_1, n_2 \leq b$

\begin{equation}
  Y[f, n_1, n_2] &=& \sum_{c=1}^C \sum_{k_1=a}^{b} \sum_{k_2=a}^b x[c, k_1, k_2]
  h_f[c, n_1-k_1, n_2-k_2] \label{eq:ch2:conv5}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Pooling}
  Typically following a convolutional layer (but not strictly), activations are subsampled with
  max pooling. Pooling adds some invariance to shifts smaller than the pooling
  size at the cost of information loss. For this reason, small pooling is
  typically done often $2\x 2$ or $3\x 3$, and the invariance to larger shifts
  comes after multiple pooling (and convolutional) layers.
  
  While initial designs of max pooling would do it in non-overlapping regions, 
  AlexNet used $3\x 3$ pooling with stride 2 in their breakthrough design,
  quoting that it gave them an increase in accuracy of roughly $0.5\%$ and
  helped prevent their network from `overfitting'. More recent networks will
  typically employ either this or the original $2\x 2$ pooling with stride 2,
  see \autoref{fig:ch2:maxpool}. A review of pooling methods in
  \citep{mishkin_systematic_2016} found them both to perform equally well.
  
  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{\imgpath/pooling_both}
    \mycaption{Max vs Average $2\x 2$ pooling}{}
    \label{fig:ch2:maxpool}
  \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Batch Normalization}
      Batch normalization proposed only very recently in
      \citep{ioffe_batch_2015} is a conceptually simpler technique. Despite
      that, it has become quite popular and has been found to be very useful.
      At its core, it is doing what standard normalization is doing, but also
      introduces two learnable parameters --- scale ($\gamma$) and offset
      ($\beta$). \eqref{eq:ch2:normalization} becomes:
      \begin{equation}
        \tilde{z}(u_1,u_2,d) = \gamma\frac{z-E[z]}{\sqrt{Var[z]}} + \beta 
				\label{eq:ch2:batch_normalization}
      \end{equation}
      These added parameters make it a \emph{renormalization} scheme, as instead of
      centring the data around zero with unit variance, it can be centred
      around an arbitrary value with arbitrary variance. S etting
      $\gamma = \sqrt{Var[z]}$ and $\beta = E[z]$, we would get the identity
      transform. Alternatively, setting $\gamma = 1$ and $\beta = 0$ (the
      initial conditions for these learnable parameters), we get standard
      normalization.
      
      The parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are learned through backpropagation.
      As data are usually processed in batches, the gradients for $\gamma$ and
      $\beta$ are calculated per sample, and then averaged over the whole
      batch.

      From \autoref{eq:ch2:batch_normalization}, let us briefly use the hat
      notation to represent the standard normalized input:
      $\hat{z} = (z-E[z])/\sqrt{Var[z]}$, then:
      \begin{eqnarray}
        \tilde{z}^{(i)} & = & \gamma \hat{z}^{(i)} + \beta \nonumber\\
        \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \gamma}& =&
        \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\partial
        \mathcal{L}^{(i)}}{\partial \tilde{z}^{(i)}} \cdot \hat{z}^{(i)} \\
        \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \beta}& =&
        \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\partial
        \mathcal{L}^{(i)}}{\partial \tilde{z}^{(i)}} 
      \end{eqnarray}

      Batch normalization layers are typically placed \emph{between} convolutional layers
      and non-linearities. I.e.,\ if $Wu+b$ is the output of a convolutional
      layer, and $z=g(Wu+b)$ is the output of the non-linearity, then with the
      batch normalization step, we have:
      \begin{eqnarray}
        z &=& g(BN(Wu+b)) \nonumber\\
          &=& g(BN(Wu))
      \end{eqnarray}
      Where the bias term was ignored in the convolutional layer, as it can be
      fully merged with the `offset' parameter $\beta$.

      This has particular benefit of removing the sensitivity of our network to
      our initial weight scale, as for scalar $a$,
      \begin{equation}
        BN(Wu) = BN((aW)u)
      \end{equation}
      It is also particularly useful for backpropagation, as an increase in
      weights leads to \emph{smaller} gradients \citep{ioffe_batch_2015}, making
      the network far more resilient to the problems of vanishing and exploding

        BN(Wu)}{\partial u} \nonumber\\
        \frac{\partial BN((aW)u)}{\partial (aW)} & = & \frac{1}{a} \cdot \frac{\partial

\subsection{Residual Networks}
  The current state of the art design introduced a clever novel feature called
  a residual unit\citep{he_deep_2015,he_identity_2016}. The inspiration for their design came from the difficulties
  experienced in training deeper networks. Often, adding an extra layer would
  \emph{decrease} network performance. This is counter-intuitive as the deeper
  layers could simply learn the identity mapping, and achieve the same
  performance.

  To promote the chance of learning the identity mapping, they define
  a residual unit, shown in \autoref{fig:ch2:residual_unit}. If a desired mapping
  is denoted $\mathcal{H}(x)$, instead of trying to learn this, they instead
  learn $\mathcal{F}(x) = \mathcal{H}(x) - x$.

\subsection{old}
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were initially introduced by \citet{lecun_backpropagation_1989} in
  \citep{lecun_backpropagation_1989}. Due to the difficulty of training and
  initializing them, they failed to be popular for more than two decades.  This
  changed in 2012, when advancements in pre-training with unsupervised networks
  \citep{bengio_greedy_2007}, the use of an improved non-linearity --- the Rectified Linear
  Unit, or ReLU, new regularization methods\citep{hinton_improving_2012}, and
  access to more powerful computers in graphics cards, or GPUs, allowed
  Krizhevsky, Sutskever and Hinton  to develop
  AlexNet\citep{krizhevsky_imagenet_2012}. This network nearly halved the
  previous state of the art's error rate.  Since then, interest in them has
  expanded very rapidly, and they have been successfully applied to object
  detection~\citep{ren_object_2015} and human pose estimation
  \citep{tompson_efficient_2015}. It would take a considerable amount of effort
  to document the details of all the current enhancements and tricks many
  researches are using to squeeze extra accuracy, so for the purposes of this
  report we restrict ourselves to their generic design, with some time spent
  describing some of the more promising enhancements. 
  
  We would like to make note of some of the key architectures
  in the history of CNNs, which we, unfortunately, do not have space to describe:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Yann LeCun's LeNet-5~\citep{lecun_gradient-based_1998}, the state of the art
      design for postal digit recognition on the MNIST dataset.
    \item Google's GoogLeNet~\citep{szegedy_going_2015} achieved $6.67\%$ top-5
      error on ILSVRC2014, introducing the new `inception' architecture, which
      uses combinations of $1\x 1$, $3\x 3$ and $5\x 5$ convolutions.
    \item Oxford's VGG~\citep{simonyan_very_2014} --- $6.8\%$ and runner up in
      ILSVRC2014. The VGG design is very similar to AlexNet but was roughly
      twice as deep. More convolutional layers were used, but with smaller
      support --- only $3\x 3$. These were often stacked directly on top of
      each other without a non-linearity in between, to give the effective
      support of a $5\x 5$ filter.
    \item Microsoft Research's ResNet~\citep{he_deep_2015} achieved $4.5\%$ top-5 
      error and was the winner of ILSVRC2015. This network we will talk briefly
      about, as it introduced a very nice novel layer --- the residual layer.
  \end{itemize}

  Despite the many variations of CNN architectures currently being used, most
  follow roughly the same recipe (shown in \autoref{fig:ch2:cnn_generic}):
  \begin{figure}

      \caption[Standard CNN architecture]
              {Standard CNN architecture. Taken
              from~\citep{lecun_gradient-based_1998}}\label{fig:ch2:cnn_generic}
  \end{figure}

\subsection{Fully Connected Layers}\label{sec:ch2:cnn_fullyconnected}
  The convolution, pooling, and activation layers all
  conceptually form part of the \emph{feature extraction} stage of a CNN. One
  or more fully connected layers are usually placed after these layers to form
  the \emph{classifier}. One of the most elegant and indeed most powerful
  features of CNNs is this seamless connection between the \emph{feature
  extraction} and \emph{classifier} sub-networks, allowing the backpropagation
  of gradients through all layers of the entire network.

  The fully connected layers in a CNN are the same as those in a classical
  Neural Network (NN), in that they compute a dot product between their input
  vector and a weight vector:
  \begin{equation}
    z_i = \sum_{j} W_{ij}x_j
  \end{equation}
  The final output of the Fully Connected layer typically has the same number
  of outputs as the number of classes $C$ in the classification problem.
