\section{Chapter Layout}
This thesis combines work in several fields. We provide a background for the
most important and relevant fields in this chapter. We first introduce the
basics of deep learning, looking at general supervised learning in \autoref{sec:ch2:supervised}
before more specifically examining the structure of Neural Networks
in \autoref{sec:ch2:nns} and CNNs in \autoref{sec:ch2:cnns}.

We then define the properties of Wavelet Transforms, looking at the difference
between the discrete WT and the complex Morlet and $\DTCWT$ in
\autoref{sec:ch2:fourier}.
Finally, we introduce the Scattering Transform or ScatterNet, the original
inspiration for this thesis in \autoref{sec:ch2:scatternets}.
