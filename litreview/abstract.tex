This thesis combines work in several fields. We provide a background for the
most important and relevant fields in this chapter. We first introduce the
definition and properties of the Wavelet Transforms, focussing on the $\DTCWT$,
then we describe the fundamentals of Convolutional Neural Networks and how they
learn, and finally we introduce the Scattering Transform, the original
inspiration for this thesis.
