\section{Discussion}
This chapter presents a way to investigate what the higher orders of a ScatterNet
are responding to - the DeScatterNet described in \autoref{sec:ch4:descatternet}.
Using this, we have shown that the second `layer' of a ScatterNet 
responds strongly to patterns that are very dissimilar to those that highly activate the
second layer of a CNN\@. As well as being dissimilar to CNNs, visual inspection of the
ScatterNet's patterns reveal that they may be less useful for discriminative
tasks, and we believe this may be causing the current gaps in state-of-the-art
performance between the two. 

Additionally, we performed occlusion tests to heuristically measure the
importance of the individual scattering channels. The results of this test
reaffirmed the suspicions raised from the visualizations. In particular, many of
the second order Scattering coefficients may not be very useful in a deep
classifier. Those that were more useful were typically when the second order wavelet
had the same orientation as the first.

Finally, we demonstrated the possible shapes attainable when we filter
across orientations with complex mixing coefficients. We believe that this 
mixing is a key step in the development of improved ScatterNets and wavelets in deep
learning systems.
