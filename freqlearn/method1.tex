\section{Parameterizing Filters in the Wavelet Domain}\label{sec:ch6:reparameterization}
This is a simple extension of the work done by Rippel et.\ al. who parameterize
their filters in the Fourier domain.
% Their work also
% added another layer called `Spectral Pooling' which effectively is a lowpass
% filter. 
As with the Fourier parameterization, a Wavelet parameterization
introduces some challenges. Most notably that any filters parameterized with a
decimated wavelet transform will naturally want to have a spatial support of a
power of 2 whereas most convolutional filters in CNNs have an odd spatial
support, typically of size 3 (and maybe more for earlier layers). This is done
for a very good reason too, in that we do not want our filters to shift the
activations. 

How much does Rippel talk about reparameterizing in the fourier domain?
