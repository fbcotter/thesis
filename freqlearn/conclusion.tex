\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we have presented the novel idea of learning filters by taking
activations into the wavelet domain. There, we can apply
the proposed wavelet \emph{gain layer} $G$ instead of a pixel-wise convolution. We can
return to the pixel domain to apply a ReLU, or stay in the wavelet domain
and apply wavelet-based nonlinearities $\sigma_{lp}, \sigma_{bp}$. We have
considered the possible challenges this proposes and described how a multi-rate
system can learn through backpropagation.

Our experiments have been promising but are still only preliminary. We have
shown that the gain layer can learn in an end-to-end system, achieving nearly
the same accuracies on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet to the reference system with
convolutional layers (\autoref{fig:ch6:gl_results}). This is a good start and shows the plausibility of
the wavelet gain layer, but more experiments on larger datasets and deeper
networks is needed. Despite the slight reduction in performance, we saw some
nice properties to the gain layer. Most of the bandpass gains are near zero
(\autoref{fig:ch6:bp_info}),
which does not affect training but could offer speedups for inference.
Additionally, doing deconvolution to visualize the sensitivity of the filters in
a gain layer showed that the system was still learning sensible shapes with nice
spatial roll-off properties (\autoref{fig:ch6:visualizations}).

We have searched for good candidates for wavelet nonlinearities, and saw that
using a ReLU on the lowpass coefficients, and
Batch Normalization and a ReLU on the magnitudes of the bandpass coefficients
improved the performance of the gain layer considerably. This is an exciting
development and indicates that we may not need to return to the pixel domain at
all, possibly eliminating the need for the inverse wavelet
transforms used in our experiments (see steps 6 and 7 in
\autoref{alg:ch6:wavelayer}). However, one needs to be careful, as taking the inverse transform
followed by taking the forward transform does not necessarily give the same
wavelet coefficients due to the redundancy of the $\DTCWT$, instead projecting
onto the range space of the transform. Removing the inverse transform is
something we did not have time to fully explore and so we have included it in
our future work section.

When we added the nonlinearities to the gain layer
we saw that we were able to achieve some
improvements in performance over a fully convolutional architecture
(\autoref{fig:ch6:nonlinear_ablation}). The proposed layer
worked best at the beginning of the CNN, which matches the intuition for doing
this work described in the introduction to the chapter. More research still
needs to be done with the gain layer as part of a deeper system.
