\begin{acknowledgements}      

  I would like to thank my supervisor Nick Kingsbury who has dedicated so
  much of his time to help my research. He has not only been instructing and
  knowledgeable, but very kind and supportive. I would also like to thank my
  advisor, Joan Lasenby for supporting me in my first term when Nick was away,
  and for always being helpful. I must also acknowledge
  YiChen Yang and Ben Chaudhri who have done fantastic work helping me develop
  ideas and code for my research.

  I sincerely thank Trinity College for both being my alma mater and
  for sponsoring me to do my research. Without their generosity I would not be
  here.

  And finally, I would like to thank my girlfriend Cordelia, and my parents
  Bill and Mary-Rose for their ongoing support.
