  Image understanding has long been a goal for computer vision. It has proved
  to be an exceptionally difficult task due to the large amounts of variability
  that are inherent to objects in scene. Recent advances in supervised learning
  methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have pushed the frontier
  of what we have been able to train computers to do. 

  Despite their successes, the mechanics of how these networks are able to
  recognize objects are little understood. Worse still is that we do not yet
  have methods or procedures that allow us to train these networks. The father
  of CNNs, Yann LeCun, summed it up as:
  \begin{quote}
    There are certain recipes (for building CNNs) that work and certain recipes
    that don't, and we don't know why.
  \end{quote}

  We believe that if we can build a well understood and well-defined network
  that mimicks CNN (i.e., it is able to extract the same features from an image, and able to
  combine these features to discriminate between classes of objects), then we
  will gain a huge amount of invaluable insight into what is required in these networks
  as well as what is learned. 
  
  In this paper we explore our attempts so far at trying to achieve this. In
  particular, we start by examining the previous work on Scatternets by
  Stephan\'{e} Mallat. These are deep networks that involve successive
  convolutions with wavelets, a well understood and well-defined topic. We draw
  parallels between the wavelets that make up the Scatternet and the learned
  features of a CNN and clarify their differences. We then go on to build a two
  stage network that replaces the early layers of a CNN with a Scatternet and
  examine the progresses we have made with it.

  Finally, we lay out our plan for improving this hybrid network, and how we
  believe we can take the Scatternet to deeper layers.
