The experiments for this thesis were run on a single server with 8 GPUs and 14
CPUs. The GPUs were each NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 cards released in May 2016.
They each have 8GiB of RAM, 2560 CUDA cores and 320 GB/s memory bandwidth.
The CPUs were Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5-2660 models. 

At the completion of the project, we were running CUDA 10.0 with cuDNN 7.6 and 
PyTorch version 1.1.

To do hyperparameter search we used the Tune package \cite{liaw2018tune} which
we highly recommend, as it makes running trials in parallel very easy.
